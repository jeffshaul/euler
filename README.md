My solutions (good or bad, I make no guarantees) to Project Euler problems are stored herein.

Each challenge has its own folder.  Within a challenge's folder, there will always be at least two files:
  1. problem.txt (not necessarily a verbatim copy of the original problem statement)
  2. solution.xxx (whatever filetype is most appropriate as a solution)
  
There could be more files in these folders such as data files, research summaries, and other helpful files.
